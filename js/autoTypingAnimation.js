Now I am interested in becoming a data scientist, data analyst, or data engineer. In college, I learned many programming languages and frameworks. But what I like the most are the lessons on machine learning and data processing. ðŸ™‚ <br> <br> Apart from machine learning, I also like creating software such as websites and mobile applications. Especially on the backend, because I'm not good at design and UI/UX.",
